Questions
____________

1. You realized you made a spelling error when using one of the constants from the pa1.h file. Instead of DEFAULT_SIZE, you've been typing DEFAUL_SIZE (without the T). How would you find and replace all occurrences of DEFAUL_SIZE in your file to be DEFAULT_SIZE?

2. What Git command(s) would you use to list files with changes since the last commit?

3. What Git command would you use to undo a bad commit that has been already pushed?

4. What Git command would you use to see the history of all your commits?
The command to see my commit history is 'git log'. This command shows all the commits that have been made in the git repository.

5. You finished the PA since you started early, but your friend hasn't and just started working on it even though it's due tonight at 11:59 pm. Your friend knows you are done with the PA and has asked you to help them so they can finish in time. What do you do to act with integrity?
